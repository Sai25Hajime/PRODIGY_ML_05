# PRODIGY_ML_05
I have developed a deep learning model based on Task-05: "Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enablingusers to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices". It is capable of identifying food items from images and estimating their calorie content. This model can aid in dietary tracking and help users make healthier food choices.

# Steps for using the dataset
1. Download the directory from the above given website link.
2. Upload them to your drive in a folder called Datasets to make things easier.
3. Then open Google Colab.
4. Add a Code cell above the given code in the ipynb file to mount your Google drive.
5. Then use the code given in the .ipynb file.

# Dataset
The dataset used was the food-101 dataset from Kaggle. It contains images of different hand gestures, which were used to train and evaluate the model. 
Here is the dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101. Download the directory and use it for the code.

# Code Execution
The code is inside the Food-Item-Recognition.ipynb file. Run the cells after mounting the drive.

# Knowledge Gained:
**1. Technical Mastery:** Through this project, I significantly improved my technical skills, particularly in using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. I delved deeper into transfer learning with pre-trained models like MobileNetV2, which allowed me to leverage existing knowledge and adapt it to new tasks. Additionally, working with data augmentation techniques, such as rescaling, flipping, and zooming, helped me understand how to make models more robust and adaptable to various inputs.

**2. Practical Insights:** I encountered several practical challenges, especially in training the model with a diverse range of food items. It was enlightening to see how critical a balanced dataset is to achieving accurate results. I learned that variability in the data could significantly impact model performance and that careful consideration of data augmentation and preprocessing steps can make a substantial difference in the modelâ€™s ability to generalize.

**3. Optimization Techniques:** Throughout the training process, I honed my skills in fine-tuning hyperparameters and learned the importance of utilizing callbacks, like early stopping and model checkpoints, to optimize performance and prevent overfitting. This hands-on experience with adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and other settings was invaluable in refining the model's accuracy and efficiency.

**4. Real-World Application:** Developing this model gave me firsthand experience in creating a practical application that integrates machine learning with real-world dietary tracking. I now appreciate the potential of AI in health and wellness, and this project showed me how technology can provide actionable insights, like estimating calorie content, to help people make informed food choices. This not only strengthened my technical skills but also fueled my interest in applying AI to solve everyday problems and improve lives.
